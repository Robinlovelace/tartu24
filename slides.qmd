**Reproducible research**: Other people can re-generate your results

. . .

**Open source software**: Software that is free to use and modify

. . .

**Open access tools**: Web applications for transport planning that are based on open source software, that anyone can use

. . .

**Open access data**: Data that is freely available to use and share

. . .

**Future-proof** work that is likely to be useful in the medium-term future

<!-- (10 years+), regardless of (political, economic, technological) changes -->

## (I-)Reproducibility

Reproducibility is a continuous variable [@peng2011]

# Reproducible research

## Why make your research (more) reproducible?

## Reproducibility and generalisability

Illustration of the ClockBoard zoning system used to visualize a geographically dependendent phenomena: air quality, measured in mass of PM10 particles, measured in micrograms per cubic meter, from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI).
The facets show the data in spatial grid available from the LAEI, facet Am and aggregated to London boroughs B, to ClockBoard zones covering all the input data shown in C, and ClockBoard zones clipped by the administrative boundary of Greater London in D.

## Drivers of demand for transport planning

transport planning software was originally designed in the late 1950s and onwards to plan for

> increased use of cars \[for personal travel\], and trucks for deliveries and goods movement @boyce2015

Thankfully that is no longer a priority:

> Policy drivers have changed dramatically since then: climate change mitigation, air quality improvement and public health are prioritised in the emergent ‘sustainable mobility paradigm’ @lovelace2021

How could/should/will demand shift in the future?

## Conclusions

-   Reproducible research is a key part of future-proofing transport planning, for your work, and for the discipline as a whole

-   Open source software and open access tools are key to this, especially if you want to have humans in the loop

-   AI is not a panacea, and has its own environmental costs

-   In this context, there are some key desirable features of future-proof transport models and associated software and tools:

    -   Open source
    -   Open access
    -   Reproducible
    -   Human-in-the-loop
    -   Easily adaptable to new data sources, methods, and demands

## Appendix: What if the machines *do* take over? {#sec-appendix}

-   Would you want the AIs to be trained on your work?
    -   Initial thought: no way, that's my data!
    -   Second thought: if the AIs are going to take over, they might as well be well-informed, by good information and good intentions!
-   Would you want to be able to understand how the AIs work?
